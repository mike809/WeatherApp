# Project Name

## Description

This is a Ruby on Rails application designed to provide weather forecast data based on user input. Users can enter an address, and the application will retrieve and display the current temperature for that location. For an enhanced experience, the application also provides extended forecast information.

To optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API calls, the application caches forecast details for each zip code for 30 minutes. Users are informed if the displayed data is pulled from the cache. This ensures that the application provides up-to-date weather information while maintaining efficient operation.
